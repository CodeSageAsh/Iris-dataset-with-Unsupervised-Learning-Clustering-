# Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

## Overview

This project explores clustering techniques in unsupervised learning to identify natural groupings within data. The notebook demonstrates various clustering algorithms, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, providing insights into how data can be grouped without predefined labels.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes several features that are used to identify clusters within the data. Common attributes include:
- **Feature 1**: Description of the first feature used for clustering.
- **Feature 2**: Description of the second feature used for clustering.
- **Feature 3**: Additional features that contribute to the clustering process.

(Note: Replace with actual feature descriptions based on your specific dataset.)

## Project Structure

- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and feature distribution.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes scaling, handling missing data, and preparing the data for clustering.
- **Clustering Models**: Implementation of various clustering algorithms such as:
  - **K-Means Clustering**: Partitioning the data into k distinct clusters.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Creating a tree-like structure of nested clusters.
  - **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering that identifies core, border, and noise points.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like silhouette score and cluster visualization to assess the quality of the clustering.
- **Visualization of Clusters**: Plotting clusters to interpret the grouping results and understand the underlying patterns.

## Key Findings

- Different clustering algorithms offer varied insights depending on the data structure.
- K-Means is effective for spherical clusters, while DBSCAN handles noise and arbitrary shapes well.

## How to Use
